    This (not very impresive) start page are planned to be replaced with an
    operational example application in a future version. If you want
    to contribute with a better "start application", feel free to submit one!

    However NanoMVC can still do cool stuff. Read 
    <a href="http://docs.nanomvc.com/">
        the documentation for more information!
